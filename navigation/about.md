<h1>About me</h1>

My name is Lars Lindain

I am a senior in high school and take Ap Comupter Science Princles. I joined the class because I have an interest in coding and animation. Alongside Computer Science, I am part of Del Norte Drumline and like spending my time playing drums. In the future I hope to invole myself in something like 3d animation beacuse I think that is very interesting.

In my family I have one other sister and we are from Phillipines origin. Both our parents are from the Philippines and we visit around every 2 years making much of our culture insprise from things supported in the Philippines.

While I current live in San Diego, i have lived in many different houses and apartments throughout the West Coast. I was born in Arizona, and while I was there for a couple years, I mainly grew up near Los Angeles- after moving just before second grade. I stayed in that area until the summer between my 10th grade and 11th grade years, when I moved to San Diego, where I will spend my last two years of high school.
