<h2>My CSP progress</h2>

<h3>In class I had a lot of obstacles and achivements over my time on CSP. Here are a list of some I had over the weeks.</h3>

<p> <strong>-8/29/24-</strong> Some problems I found on the way was trying to transfer the template over to VScode. Because I use mac, it was different procedure than the people around me, and the instruction code didn't and did allow me to copy the template properly. To get around this, I copied the template maunnally through the gitclone and imported it into VScode. <p>


<p> <strong>-9/3/24-</strong> I had trouble figuring out how to add a notebook to the home page menu. I solved ths by going into config and opening access to the md file through there. <p>

<p> <strong>-9/17/24-</strong> I couldn't figure out how to imbed my snake game into my page. The only way to play snake is through the terminal but it opens in a different window. <p>
