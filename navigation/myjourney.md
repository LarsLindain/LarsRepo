<h1>My Journey</h1>

During my first weeks here in Ap Computer Science Princles I was no short of confused. While there were durections listed, navagating alone was a challege. But like any class, Mr. Brown gave us the right tips and info to move us though the class and I was able to advance past my first assignemnt, being this website!

My goals for this class is to be able to comfortable code and work my way around terminals without needing help. Hopefully I am able to make more advance code by the end of this year without to many templates.
