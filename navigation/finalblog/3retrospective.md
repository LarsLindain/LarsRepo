<h2> Retrospective</h2>


<p>In the future I hope I can build on both my strengths and weaknesses, 
I want to try and be able to work and code with a lot less need to search problems up and ask the ones around me to help fix certain issues. 
I am most glad i was able to work ina team and we were able to work together on 1 feature instead of multiple features.</p>

<h3> College Plans </h3>

<p> I commited to Penn state and want to see if I can major change into Data science or Computer Science by my juinor year.</p>
