<h2> Retrospective</h2>

<p>Overally this TRI I feel like I have a far great extent of understanding of the class than 12 weeks ago. While I still believe there is plenty of room to grow, I am proud of the progress I have made this Trimester.</p>

<p>In the future I hope I can build on both my strengths and weaknesses, I want to try and be able to work and code with a lot less need to search problems up and ask the ones around me to help fix certain issues. I also hope I am able to contribute to my group more in the future. This Trimester I mainly kept to myself and only collaborated during the later half of the Trimester.</p>

<h3> College Plans </h3>

<p> As a senior its high time to start really thinking about the college to go to. As of now I am deciding between a couple schools. I had got accepted for Data Science in UIC. I also got accepted into Penn State, but on my alternate major: Graphic Design. While I am still waiting for a few response I have to decide it is worth going to a better college for a major I am not full commited in.</p>
