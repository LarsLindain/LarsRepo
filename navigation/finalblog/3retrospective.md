<h2> Retrospective</h2>


<p>In the future I hope I can build on both my strengths and weaknesses, I want to try and be able to work and code with a lot less need to search problems up and ask the ones around me to help fix certain issues. I also hope I am able to contribute to my group more in the future. This Trimester I mainly kept to myself and only collaborated during the later half of the Trimester.</p>

<h3> College Plans </h3>

<p> I commited to Penn state and want to see if I can major change into Data science or Computer Science by my juinor year.</p>
