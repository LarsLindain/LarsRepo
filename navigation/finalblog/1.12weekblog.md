 <h2>12 Week Reflection</h2>

<p> Over the past 12 Weeks I felt like I have made leaps of progress in terms of my Computer Science ability. This page is a blog to represent my advancments and acheviments.</p>

<h3> Key Learning Progress</h3>

-   Frontend/ Backend API Integration - Implemented API routes for communication between frontend and backend.
-   Implemented authentication using JWT tokens. - Used token-based authentication for secure user posts.

```javascript
class BinaryOverflowPostAPI:
    # Fetches data for Frontend to build
    class fetch_frontend(Resource):
        def get(self):
            posts = BinaryOverflowContent.query.all()
            json_ready = [post.read() for post in posts]
            return json_ready
        
        @token_required()
        def post(self):
            current_user = g.current_user
            data = request.get_json()
            post = BinaryOverflowContent(data["title"], current_user.id, data["content"])
            post.create()
            return jsonify(post.read())

    # CRUD for the content model
    class POST_CRUD(Resource):
        def get(self):
            post_id = request.args.get('id')
            try:
                post = BinaryOverflowContent.query.get(post_id)
                post_json_ready = post.read()
                comments = post.comments
                comments_json_ready = [comment.read() for comment in comments]
                return {
                    'post': post_json_ready,
                    'comments': comments_json_ready
                }
            except Exception as e:
                return "There was an issue with fetching the post: " + str(e)

```
-    Team colaboration and coordination - Much stronger team work during the second half of Tri 2 created strong momentum

-   Full stack Demo - Learned the base aspects of CRUD

-   Incredible Growth in frontend Styling - Personal favorite skill, much more satisfied with how my frontend turned out

```javascript

.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    margin-top: 20px;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
/* Main Content */
.main-content {
    flex: 10; /* Allows main content to expand */
    min-width: 1000px; /* Prevents sidebar from being too large */
    max-width: 2000px; /* Ensures it stays small */
    background: lightcyan;
    padding:45px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```


<h3> Learing Improvements</h3>

-   API had many authentifcation bugs 

-   Unclean code led to new problems after fixing one

-   Having the GET method run as the POST method runs so the user does not need to reload after every post

<h3> Project Features </h3>

I made 2 main features during this TRI, both using full API integration and application.

-1. Logic Gate Lesson and Quiz

<p>This was a learning site that help users learn how to understand and use basic Logic Gates. Each page included a lesson and short quiz, which you could then take your score and return to the main page to save your score and compare your previous scores or other users' scores.</p>

-2. BinaryOverflow Blog and Community page

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zfm6WPD3/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-2-29-59-AM.png" alt="Binary Overflow" width="600">

<p>After rebranding our groups site, I used what I learned from my logic gates feature to create a new feature that implamented a post mechanism that is used for you and others to see. I worked with Vincent to create a page called Binary Overflow, inspired by the popualr site StackOverflow. The Core idea is the same, with users able to create, read, update, and delete posts sent to the site for the community to talk about binary topics.</p>
