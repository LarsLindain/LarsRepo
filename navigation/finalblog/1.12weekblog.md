 <h2>12 Week Reflection</h2>

<p> Over the past 12 Weeks I felt like I have made leaps of progress in terms of my Computer Science ability. This page is a blog to represent my advancments and acheviments.</p>

<h3> Key Learning Progress</h3>

- Code block for API Integration

```javascript
// --- Points API Integration ---
  class Points {
    constructor({ pythonURI, fetchOptions }) {
      this.pythonURI = pythonURI;
      this.fetchOptions = fetchOptions;
      this.points = 0;
      this.pointsDisplay = document.getElementById('pointsAmount');
      this.init();
    }

    async init() {
      await this.fetchPoints();
      this.startAutoIncrement();
    }

    async fetchPoints() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(`${this.pythonURI}/api/points`, {
          ...this.fetchOptions,
          method: 'GET',
        });
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch points');
        const data = await response.json();
        this.points = data.points?.points || 0;
        this.updateDisplay();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching points:', error);
      }
    }
```javascript
```


<h3> Learing Improvements</h3>

- I learned a lot about teamwork and collaboration, working this past tri in the group of 3 really taught me how to communitcate with others and trust other members.

<h3> Project Features </h3>

I made 2 main features during this TRI, both using full API integration and application.
