 <h2>12 Week Reflection</h2>

<p> Over the past 12 Weeks I felt like I have made leaps of progress in terms of my Computer Science ability. This page is a blog to represent my advancments and acheviments.</p>

<h3> Key Learning Progress</h3>

- Code block for API entity classes

```javascript
class Enemy {
  constructor(game, config) {
    this.game = game;
    this.x = (config.customStart ? config.customStart.x : pathPoints[0].x);
    this.y = (config.customStart ? config.customStart.y : pathPoints[0].y);
    this.speed = config.speed;
    this.size = config.size;
    this.health = config.health;
    this.maxHealth = config.health;
    this.coinReward = config.coinReward || 10;
    this.isRoyalGhost = !!config.isRoyalGhost;
    this.troopName = config.troopName || null;
    this.currentIndex = config._witchPathIndex || 0;
    this.progress = 0;
    this.start = config.customStart || pathPoints[this.currentIndex];
    this.end = pathPoints[this.currentIndex + 1];
    this.segmentDistance = Math.hypot(this.end.x - this.start.x, this.end.y - this.start.y);
    this.lastTimestamp = null;
    this.alive = true;
```


<h3> Learing Improvements</h3>

- I learned a lot about teamwork and collaboration, working this past tri in the group of 3 really taught me how to communitcate with others and trust other members.

<h3> Project Features </h3>

I made 2 main features during this TRI, my highlight working with Pradyun and Darsh on a Tower defense game.
