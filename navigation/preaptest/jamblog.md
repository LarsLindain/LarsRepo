<h2> 5.1 benifital and Harmful Effects </h2>

<p> Beneficial Effects of Technology </p>
-	Automated phone systems reduce hold time and save companies money.
-	Medical technology like MRI and DNA sequencing help diagnose and treat diseases faster.
-	Vaccines for illnesses like COVID were only possible due to modern technology.
-	Online access to encyclopedias, articles, and e-books makes education more widely available.
-	Search engines like Google provide instant access to massive amounts of information.

<p>Harmful Effects of Technology </p>
-	Cyberbullying and online dangers threaten children’s mental health and safety.
-	Social media can negatively affect teen self-esteem and mental health.
-	Dangerous trends on social platforms have led to injuries and even deaths.
-	Unmonitored internet use exposes kids to scams and inappropriate content.
-	Legal actions have been taken against social media platforms over harmful impacts.

<p>Neutral (Both Beneficial and Harmful Effects) </p>
-	Artificial Intelligence boosts productivity and helps in education and healthcare, but raises ethical, environmental, and misinformation concerns.
-	Drones improve rescue missions, farming, and surveillance, but pose privacy risks and safety issues when misused.
-	Gene editing may cure genetic diseases and improve crops, but carries ethical risks and can cause irreversible genetic harm.

<h2> 5.2 The Digital Divide </h2>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tR1bVrnr/image-2025-04-24-094804641.png" alt="Digital Divide" width="500" height="300">

<p>Digital Divide Overview</p>  
- Technology access is uneven, especially in rural and low-income areas.  
- This gap limits opportunities in education, employment, healthcare, and community involvement.  
- The digital divide also exists in developed cities like San Diego, particularly near the border.  

<p>Causes and Bias</p>  
- Wealthier communities can afford better digital infrastructure.  
- Bias in computing innovations can exclude underrepresented users.  
- Developers may unintentionally design software that doesn’t meet the needs of all groups.  

<p>Solutions to Bridge the Divide</p>  
- Expand infrastructure and public Wi-Fi in underserved areas.  
- Subsidize internet and device costs for low-income families.  
- Create inclusive technologies that work for all users.  
- Advocate for public policy supporting digital equity.  

<h2> 5.3 Computing Bias </h2>

<p>What is Computing Bias?</p>  
- Computing bias happens when algorithms or systems produce unfair outcomes for certain groups.  
- This bias can come from flawed data, biased design, or unintended programming consequences.  
- Example: Netflix recommendations may reinforce user preferences, limiting content diversity.

<p>Types of Computing Bias</p>  
- **Algorithmic Bias**: Flawed systems that produce consistently biased results.  
- **Data Bias**: Bias originating from skewed or incomplete data sets.  
- **Cognitive Bias**: Researcher unintentionally selects data supporting personal beliefs.

<p>Intentional vs. Unintentional Bias</p>  
- **Intentional Bias**: Developers knowingly include biased rules (e.g., resume filtering favoring certain groups).  
- **Unintentional Bias**: Occurs when systems are trained on biased or incomplete data (e.g., facial recognition failing on darker skin tones).  

<h2> 5.4 Crowdsourcing </h2>

<p>What is Crowdsourcing?</p>  
- Crowdsourcing is gathering input or solutions from a large group of people, typically via the internet.  
- It helps reduce computing bias by incorporating diverse perspectives.  
- Enables global collaboration through distributed computing systems.  

<p>Types of Crowdsourcing</p>  
- **Crowdfunding**: Raising money from many small donors (e.g., Kickstarter, GoFundMe).  
- **Crowd Creation**: Content generated by a community (e.g., Wikipedia, design contests).  
- **Crowd Voting**: Public opinion guides decisions (e.g., Reddit upvotes, polls).  
- **Crowd Wisdom**: Leveraging collective intelligence (e.g., Stack Overflow, prediction markets).  

<p>Data Crowdsourcing</p>  
- Collecting and verifying data from a large online group.  
- Examples include: Wikipedia, Google Maps, and Amazon Mechanical Turk.  
- **Benefits**: Rapid, scalable, cost-efficient data collection from diverse sources.  
- **Challenges**: Ensuring accuracy, respecting privacy, and motivating volunteers.  

<h2> 5.5 Legal and Ethical Issues </h2>

<p>Legal Concerns in Software Development</p>  
- **Intellectual Property (IP)** laws protect digital creations like code, designs, and trademarks.  
- **Copyright** gives automatic legal protection to original works and prohibits unauthorized use.  
- **Licensing** defines how others can use, modify, or share your code; without one, it’s “All Rights Reserved.”  
- **Software licenses** (MIT, GPL, Apache 2.0, etc.) set clear rules for collaboration and reuse.  
- Violating software licenses can result in repo takedowns, legal action, or fines.

<p>Open Source vs Open Access</p>  
- **Open Source Software**: Freely available code that users can modify and redistribute under specific licenses.  
- **Open Access Code**: Research and code that’s free of access restrictions, with minimal use limitations.  
- **Benefits**: Encourages collaboration and accessibility.  
- **Risks**: May be misused if modified maliciously or without proper credit.

<h2> Big O and Algorithm Analysis </h2>

<p>Why Algorithm Efficiency Matters</p>  
- Efficient algorithms improve app speed and user experience.  
- Save resources like memory and processing power, especially on mobile or high-load systems.  
- Scalability ensures performance remains strong with larger datasets.  
- Real-world systems (e.g., streaming, search engines) depend on efficient data processing.

<p>String Reversal Efficiency</p>  
- **Speed-Optimized (s[::-1])**: Fast but uses more memory (O(n) time, O(n) space).  
- **Memory-Optimized**: Slower due to list insertions but may save memory.  
- Ideal choice depends on the app’s performance vs. memory needs.
