<H2>About Drumline</h2>

<p>High school drumline is a core part of a high schoolâ€™s marching band program, where students play a variety of percussion instruments, including snare drums, bass drums, and cymbals. I play snare for the Del Norte Drumline and we are found often performing at football games, parades, and competitive events. Drumlines are known for their high-energy performances, synchronized movements, and elaborate showmanship, which contribute significantly to the visual and auditory impact of the marching band. Be part of the drumline is a lot of work, being outside in the heat holding up drums weights dozens of pounds. Yet I still come back every year because it is a fun challege that separates my mind off academics.</p>
